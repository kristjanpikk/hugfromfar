        <p>Mari moved to Italy 15 years ago and since then she has travelled to Estonia and back hundreds of time. While in Estonia she is always visiting her 85-years old grand aunt Selma. In the end of last year Selma’s health got worse and she moved to Kilingi Villa.</p>
        <p>Mari promised to visit her right when coming to Estonia. But then coronavirus spread all over the world and countries went into lockdown. Selma and Mari were both sad and devastated, because they hadn’t seen each other for a whole year. Kilingi Villa staff were also worried about their inhabitants and instantly gladly agreed to participate in the Pilot project for Hug from Far. It took only a few hours to teach caregivers how to manage the iPad they got. At first Selma was a little afraid of this device, but now she is more than happy.</p>
        <p>Although she still misses Mari very much, Selma says that one of the big advantages of virtual communication is that now she can see their whole family together and even Maris dogs and she never knew that Mari has such a beautiful garden and backyard. And she might have never seen Italian mountains, but Mari showed her the view from her bedroom. Mari is so grateful to the project that decided to become the first permanent donor.</p>

        <p>The Kaarepere retirement home in Paide has 60 people living there, until Hug from Far they didn’t have any smart devices for the elderly to use. They agreed to pilot the service due to the restrictions created to manage the current pandemic.</p>
        <p>„It was so exciting when the parcel with our new tablets arrived, “said the head nurse of the retirement home. „Me and the rest of the staff had online courses to learn how to use them and how to help our patients to use them. First, we were a little worried they would manage, but they have gotten used to the tablets in no time.“</p>
        <p>First call was made between 89-year-old Elsa and her grand-daughter Margit, who had just given birth to Elsas 7th great grandchild in a hospital in Tallinn.</p>
        <p>Elsa said that it was the most beautiful thing to experience. “During these dark times, there is still light and hope. There is so much love. We just need a way to spread it and Hug from Far will help us to do that.”</p>
